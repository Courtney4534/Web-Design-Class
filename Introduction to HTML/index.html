    <h2>Welcome to My Site</h2>
    <p>Mushrooms are super interesting and useful for everyday life.
        Scientists have discovered many new uses for mushrooms that range from 
        a natural source of caffeine to strains that help with sleep. Reishi is a 
        mushroom that supports immune, kidney, liver, cardiovascular, and nervous
        system functions making it super versatile for everyone to use as a daily
        supplement. Another type of mushroom that is used in making coffee and 
        helping with focus is Lion's Mane,as it targets the brain and the production 
        of nerve growth factor. I have taken these types of mushrooms before and I can 
        say they help with brain fog, keeping me energized throughout the day, 
        and I retain information way easier. With expanding research of these 
        funguses we could change they way we live by adding these mushrooms
        into our daily lives.
