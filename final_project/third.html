            <h2>What to Plant in Your Zone</h2>
            <p>The standard by which gardeners and growers 
                can determine which plants are most likely to
                thrive at a location. There are maps based on the 
                average annual minimum winter temperature, divided 
                into 10-degree F zones and further divided into 5-degree 
                F half-zones. Determining which zone you are in can 
                determine what you can and cannot grow easily in your 
                state. There are 13 growing zones and each state can 
                be a apart of more than one zone depending on the climate. 
                   </p>

            <h2>How Climate Affects Plants</h2>
            <p> Climate is one of the main factors of growing plants and 
                why many people do not start. Without the knowledge on when 
                and where you can grow a certain plant can make gardening 
                seem difficult. Knowing how percipitation, temperature, 
                and soil can affect you garden can be beneficial to keeping 
                a garden all througout the year. One way climate affects 
                plants is the amount of percipitation that falls in a certain 
                location. Another way is the temperature, if a plant gets too 
                cold or does not get enough sunlight it may never grow, but there 
                are some plants who do not need a lot of heat or sunlight to grow. </p>
