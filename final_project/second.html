            <h2>Where to Start When Gardening</h2>
            <p> Gardening can be intimidating at first but there 
                are a lot of useful websites and videos that can 
                help you get started on switching to a home 
                grown vegetable diet. The first thing you should 
                do is find the location you want to start which 
                can be inside your home, outside in the yard, or 
                in a greenhouse. Next you want to set up a watering 
                system or plan on when you should water your plants. 
                After that, you want to look into your gardening zone 
                to see what produce grows best in your zone by state. 
                This will determine what soil, tools, and seeds to buy 
                for your garden set up. In the beginning you will want 
                to be in your garden as much as possible making sure you 
                are watering them correctly and preventing bugs from 
                terrorizing your new plants, but after awhile you will 
                be a natural. </p>

            <h3>Gardening outside/greenhouse</h3>
            <p>There are so many different ways to garden nowadays and 
                two of the most common are outside in a garden box or in 
                a greenhouse. Gardening outside is beneficial for the plants 
                as some plants thrive off the climate and direct sunlight. 
                Also, plants outside do not need to be watered as much as 
                they can last off of rain water as well as when you water them. 
                The benefit to using a greenhouse for gardening produce is 
                that you can control the climate and what comes in and out. 
                Having plants in a greenhouse can make it to where you can 
                still get the needed sunlight without bugs or the climate 
                disturbing your plants that may not grow as well in your 
                zone. Whichever you prefer doing your research and planning 
                for anything will be beneficial in the long run. </p>
