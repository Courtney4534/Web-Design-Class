            <h2>Why Garden at Home?</h2>
            <p> Gardening at home can benefit your health, community,
                and quality of life. Having accessible groceries at 
            your fingertips can lead to more healthier food options
            and lead to you being outside more to plant and harvest
            Another things planting your own food saves you from is 
            pesticides and harmful chemicals put into crops harvested 
            by grocery stores. Leaving these harfum chemicals out of 
            your diet can lead to a better gut health and feeling less
            tired as you are getting all the nutrition you are missing 
            out on when buying from the supermarket. </p>

            <h3>Gardening Can Be Fun</h3>
            <p>You can garden alone or with people who make it a fun 
                time. Gardening is for all ages and can be done all 
                summer if you are looking for a tame outdoor activity. 
                Being able to go outside and work with nature can be 
                rewarding and helps you get out and active. Doing it 
                with people in your community can lead to new friendships 
                and even events where you can buy or sell products you've 
                grown. </p>
