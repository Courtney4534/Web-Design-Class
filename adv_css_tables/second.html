            <h2>Forest Fires</h2>
            <p>Forest fires can happen any time of the year and can be caused by someone leaving embers in a fire near a dry forest area or by lightning striking a tree while we are in a drought. Some forest fires can be beneficial for the area as people can control burns to help with excess grass, brush, and dead trees that could potentially start an out-of-control fire. Each year these fires grow larger and spread farther than usual as the climate is changing and leaving places with severe droughts during the hot months. These fires do happen randomly and can be hard to catch in time for people to evacuate or get somewhere safe, but there are ways we can combat these fires. When a forest fire breaks out there will be news coverage and the surrounding areas will be notified to evacuate as quickly as possible before the fire can spread and cause lives to be lost. To help combat these fires the Forest service has implemented a National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy that includes resilient landscapes, fire adapted communities, and safe and effective wildfire response. These strategies will increase the amount of knowledge for firefighters and families when it comes to staying safe during these tragic events. </p>

                <h2> Saftey Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always fully extinguish a camp fire before leaving your camp site </li>
                <li>Be aware of thunderstorms and dry areas while camping or hiking </li>
                <li>Having a home that is made from materials that are not easily caught on fire </li>
                <li>Having evacuation routes and safe zones in more dry or forested areas </li>
            </ul></aside>

            <h2>Volcanoes and Earthquakes</h2>
            <p>Volcanoes and earthquakes are two natural disasters that occur due to shifts in tectonic plates under the Earth’s crust and can happen at any given time. When an earthquake occurs near a volcano it can cause it to erupt as it severely moves these plates. Earthquakes on their own can be deadly as some can be strong enough to demolish buildings or create cracks in the Earth’s surface. Volcanoes are also extremely deadly as they spew molten lava that can burn through almost anything, while volcanic ash can damage the climate in the surrounding area. There is no stopping these two phenomena but being prepared can help your chance of survival even If you just look for the signs of one beginning to happen. Most firefighters and first responders are trained for these two events but staying inside and staying underneath something sturdy will be something you can do as you wait for help to arrive.  </p>
