            <h2>Hurricanes</h2>
            <p>Hurricanes are the deadliest natural disasters in the world as they have caused the most deaths and leave the most damage and destruction to the areas they hit. They produce strong winds, storm surge flooding, and heavy rainfall that can lead to inland flooding, tornadoes, and rip currents. These storms are caused by low system tropical storms spinning over warm ocean waters, and they can get up to 180 MPH depending on the size. Hurricanes are detectable before they hit land, but we never know how strong they will be until they get close to land, making them deadly if you are unaware of one approaching. Once one is headed to a certain area warning will be released for people to evacuate or seek shelter in far areas from the shore. Even with these warnings some people cannot find shelter or housing from the storm and have to face it head on, which can be extremely hazardous if they donâ€™t know how to protect themselves.  </p>

            <h3>First Responders and Volunteers</h3>
            <p>Since natural disasters can happen at any time it is always good to be prepared and have people who know what to do in these situations. First responders and volunteers are the first called once a natural disaster occurs as they help clean up destruction and look for injured civilians that got caught up in these tragedies. Having these people to help during hard times makes getting back to normal easier and faster, especially when people volunteer to help as well. Anyone can volunteer to help after a disaster happens as there are tons of jobs available such as cleaning debris, handing out supplies, and looking for survivors. First responders are very appreciated as they learn exactly what they need to do in these situations to guarantee the safest rescues and removal of dangerous debris. Natural disasters are unpredictable in the long run and can happen almost anywhere in the world, having the information you need to survive can save lives.  </p>
