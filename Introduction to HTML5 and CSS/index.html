        <h2>What do Bees do?</h2>
        <p>Bees have an extremeley important job in nature and are one of the 
            main reasons nature is still flourishing today. Bees are know 
            as pollinators, a pollinator is an animal that carries pollen from one 
            plant to another as they collect it or eat nectar from a flower. 
            Other animals can do this such as; bats, birds, and butterflies, but none 
            compare to how much a bee can spread pollen due to their furry legs and 
            colony size. Bees also create honey which is used all throughout the
            world and in bee hives to help sustain the worker bees and the queen bee. 
            The USDA has stated that 3/4 of the world's flowering plants 
            and 30% of the world's crop production is dependent on these pollinators. 
            Having bees around is crucial to keeping our whole ecosystem from collapsing 
            and keeping our natural resources high and fruitful.

        <h2>What is honey?</h2>
        <img src="images2/honeyjar.jpg" alt="Honey Jar">
        <p>Honey is a sticky substance made in bee hives, this substance consists of
            glucose and frucose which makes it sweeter than regular sugar. 
            It also contains vitamins, minerals, and nutrients humans need to survive, making it beneficial 
            to our health to consume. Since honey is packed with all of these 
            things it can be used in a number of ways including medicinal and nutritional purposes. 
            Honey has been used for hundreds of years in dressing wounds as it is very effective
            in the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections from entering the body.
            The shelf life of honey is indefinitley even if it crystalizes, this property
            makes it easy to keep readily available and helps baked goods stay fresh longer. 
            Mead is an alcohol made from honey and is usually on the cheaper side since 
            it can be made simple and sweet depending on how it is made. There are so many 
            benefits from honey and having bees here to make it is one reason why we need to 
            protects bees and harvest honey in more humane and natural ways.
