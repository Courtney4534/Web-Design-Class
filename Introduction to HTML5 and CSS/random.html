        <h2>How are We Harming Bees?</h2>
        <p>Bees are seen everywhere during the spring and summer as they collect pollen 
            and can be found in a variety of beekeeping farms. Both of these environments 
            are threatening the lives of bees and have only increased over time as big 
            corporations become more profitable. This is due to bees losing their habitats,
            extreme farming practices, climate change, and pesticides used on plants. 
            Air pollutants also pose a risk to bees being able to locate pollen as it 
            can alter the smell of the air leading to bees not being able to find flowers
            at all. Bees being transported from farm to farm can lead to many deaths as 
            they are not able to leave the hive during travel and being handled improperly
            can lead to parasites and diseases among the colonies. All of these factors
            are pushing bees to extinction and will only increase if we as humans do not 
            change the way we are treating the environment.

        <h2>How Can We Save the Bees?</h2>
        
        <p>The world is starting to see how beneficial pollinators can be to the environment 
            and why we need to protect them to survive. As countries all over the globe 
            recognize the need to take action against climate change and mass extinctions 
            they have also considered how bees are at risk from these changes as well.
            There have been strides in educating the world and trying to pass bills 
            that are effective in reducing and banning the use of pesticides. In 
            Europe scientists believe crop diversity, combating climate change, 
            focusing on habitat conservation, and promoting biodiversity would be some 
            of the key elements to sustaing the lives of bees and life itself. 
            The government is responsible in making these changes and without awareness 
            of this cause the people would not be able to voice their concerns and get 
            the ball rolling on making these things possible. National bees day is one way 
            we have spread awareness about these issues and ways people can change their 
            day to day life to help reduce harm on pollinators.
